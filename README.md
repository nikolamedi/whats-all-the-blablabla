# whats-all-the-blablabla
A small project analyzing what we are talking about at transport conferences

# Project description

The idea of this project is to summarize and analyze the content of high-level events on transport and climate change. It fetches the transcripts of Youtube videos and summarizes them as word clouds. Now that all major conferences are being held online and the recordings are uploaded to YouTube, it is possible to get their content. It can show the main themes of a conference and how the key topics changed over time.

The code combines the packages [Youtube-Transcript-API developed by @jdepoix](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api) and [Wordcloud by @amueller](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud).

# Analysis

As a first example, I analyzed the following events:
* SLOCAT's COP23 Transport Talk Shows (November 2017)
* SLOCAT's and Transport Decarbonisation Alliance's En Route to COP26 (December 2020)
* International Transport Forum's 2021 Summit (May 2021)
* GIZ Transport and Climate Change Week (June 2021)
